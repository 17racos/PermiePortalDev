  description: |-
    Raspberry (Rubus idaeus) is a deciduous perennial shrub that produces small, aggregate fruit composed of multiple drupelets. The plant has upright or trailing canes that can grow up to 1.8 m (6 ft) tall, and many varieties have thorny stems. It is highly valued for its sweet and tart berries, which are rich in antioxidants and vitamins.

    Raspberries grow best in well-draining, slightly acidic soil with high organic matter. They require a period of winter dormancy to produce fruit and thrive in regions with cool winters and mild summers. They spread via underground runners and can form dense thickets if not maintained.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun for maximum fruit production.
    - Requires well-draining, fertile soil with moderate moisture.
    - Avoid overly wet or waterlogged conditions, as roots are prone to rot.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Cuttings: Root cuttings taken from healthy canes can be transplanted.
    - Suckers: New shoots that emerge from the root system can be dug up and replanted.
    - Seeds: Less common due to slow germination and genetic variability.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Fruits ripen from mid-summer to early fall, depending on variety.
    - Harvest when berries are fully colored and easily detach from the stem.
    - Pick regularly to encourage continued production.
  purpose: |-
    Raspberry serves multiple functions in a permaculture system:

    - Edible: The fruit is widely consumed fresh, dried, or processed into jams, juices, and baked goods.
    - Medicinal: Raspberry leaves are used in herbal teas to support reproductive health and digestive function.
    - Pollinator: Raspberry flowers attract bees and other pollinators, improving fruit set.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides food and habitat for birds and beneficial insects.
    - Erosion Control: Dense root systems help stabilize soil and prevent erosion on slopes.
