  description: |-
    Basil is a tender annual herb that typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) with a similar spread. It features bright green, oval-shaped leaves that emit a strong, distinct aroma when crushed. Some varieties may have purple or variegated foliage. Basil produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, ranging from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Regular watering is essential, but avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal issues. Propagation is commonly done through seeds sown indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date, or by taking cuttings from established plants. Harvesting can begin once the plant has at least six sets of leaves; regularly pinching off the top sets of leaves encourages bushier growth and delays flowering. For optimal flavor, harvest leaves in the morning after the dew has dried.

    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to alleviate digestive issues, reduce inflammation, and as an antimicrobial agent.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing biodiversity in the garden.
    - Pollinator Support: Provides a nectar source for pollinators, supporting their populations.
    - Border Plant: Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for edging garden beds, adding aesthetic appeal.
    - Pest Management: Basil's strong aroma can repel certain pests, and it is often planted alongside tomatoes and peppers to deter insects.
