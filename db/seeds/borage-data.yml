  description: |-
    Borage (Borago officinalis) is an annual herb known for its striking blue, star-shaped flowers and fuzzy, cucumber-flavored leaves. It grows quickly, reaching heights of 60–90 cm (2–3 feet) with a sprawling habit. Borage is highly attractive to pollinators and beneficial insects.

    The plant thrives in a variety of soil conditions but prefers well-drained, sandy, or loamy soils. It is drought-tolerant once established and self-seeds prolifically, making it an easy-to-grow addition to gardens, food forests, and medicinal herb beds.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Grows well in well-drained, moderately fertile soil.
    - Requires moderate watering but is drought-tolerant once established.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow in early spring or late summer; germinates quickly in warm soil.
    - Self-seeding: Readily self-seeds, often returning year after year in favorable conditions.
    - Transplanting: Can be transplanted when young, but prefers direct sowing.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested at any time for culinary or medicinal use.
    - Flowers should be harvested fresh when fully open for the best flavor.
    - Seeds mature in late summer and can be collected for future planting.
  purpose: |-
    Borage serves multiple functions in a permaculture system:

    - Edible: Leaves and flowers are used in salads, teas, and herbal infusions.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to support adrenal function, digestion, and skin health.
    - Pollinator: Flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other beneficial pollinators.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides nectar for pollinators and supports beneficial predatory insects.
    - Mulcher: Large leaves decompose quickly, adding organic matter to the soil.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Draws up trace minerals such as potassium and calcium, enriching the surrounding soil.
    - Erosion Control: Deep roots help improve soil structure and prevent erosion.
    - Border Plant: Works well in garden borders and food forests, adding biodiversity.
    - Pest Management: Attracts beneficial predatory insects such as hoverflies that help control aphids.
