  description: |-
    Thyme is a low-growing, woody-stemmed herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves and produces tiny, tubular flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple during the summer. Typically reaching heights of 6 to 12 inches, thyme forms dense mats that are both ornamental and functional in gardens. Its strong, pleasant aroma and flavor make it a staple in culinary dishes, while its medicinal properties have been valued since ancient times.
