  description: |-
    Borage is an annual herbaceous plant reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet (30 to 90 cm). It features coarse, hairy stems and leaves, with vibrant blue, star-shaped flowers that bloom from early summer to fall. Thriving in full sun, borage prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Propagation is typically achieved through direct sowing of seeds after the last frost; the plant readily self-seeds, ensuring its presence in subsequent seasons. Harvest young leaves when they are tender for culinary uses, and collect flowers as they open for garnishes or herbal preparations.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, borage serves multiple functions:
    - Edible: Young leaves and flowers have a mild cucumber flavor, suitable for salads, beverages, and garnishes.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to alleviate fevers, coughs, and depression; borage oil, rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), has anti-inflammatory properties. 
    - Wildlife Attractor: Its nectar-rich flowers draw pollinators like bees and beneficial insects, enhancing biodiversity.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Accumulates minerals such as potassium in its leaves, enriching compost and improving soil fertility when the plant decomposes. 
    - Pollinator Support: Provides a continuous nectar source, supporting pollinator populations throughout the growing season.
    - Border Plant: With its attractive flowers and foliage, borage can define garden edges and add aesthetic appeal.
    - Pest Management: Attracts beneficial insects that prey on common pests; may deter certain pests like tomato hornworms and cabbage worms.
