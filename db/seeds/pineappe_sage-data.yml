    Pineapple Sage is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and Guatemala, belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae). It typically grows 3 to 5 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, featuring bright green, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong pineapple fragrance when crushed. The plant produces vibrant red, tubular flowers in late summer to fall, attracting hummingbirds and butterflies. Preferring full sun to partial shade and well-drained, moist soil, Pineapple Sage thrives in rich, organic matter with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0. It is frost-tender and may require protection or indoor overwintering in cooler climates.
