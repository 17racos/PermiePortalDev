  description: |-
    Oregano (*Origanum vulgare*) is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and small, purple or white flowers. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) and spreads about 18 inches (45 cm) wide. Oregano thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure and is drought-tolerant once established. Its robust flavor and fragrance make it a staple in culinary dishes, particularly in Italian and Greek cuisines.
