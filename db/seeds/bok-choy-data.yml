  description: |-
    Bok Choy (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis) is a fast-growing, cool-season leafy green vegetable commonly used in Asian cuisine. It forms loose, upright rosettes with dark green, tender leaves and thick, crunchy white stems. Depending on the variety, it can grow between 15–45 cm (6–18 inches) in height.

    Bok Choy thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and is best grown in spring and fall to avoid bolting in hot weather. It is highly nutritious, rich in vitamins A, C, and K, and is a good source of calcium and antioxidants. The plant is commonly grown in vegetable gardens, raised beds, and containers.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil with consistent moisture.
    - Needs regular watering; avoid water stress to prevent premature bolting.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow in early spring or late summer for fall crops.
    - Transplants: Start seeds indoors 4–6 weeks before the last frost and transplant outdoors when seedlings are 10 cm (4 inches) tall.
    - Regrowing: Can be regrown from cut bases placed in water until roots develop.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Baby Bok Choy can be harvested as early as 30 days after planting.
    - Full-size plants are ready in 45–60 days.
    - Outer leaves can be harvested individually, or the entire plant can be cut at the base.
