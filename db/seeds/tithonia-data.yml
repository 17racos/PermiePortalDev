  description: |-
    Tithonia, commonly known as Mexican Sunflower, is a fast-growing, heat-tolerant flowering plant that produces vibrant orange-red blooms. It reaches heights of 1.5–3 meters (5–10 feet) and spreads widely, making it an excellent choice for borders and hedgerows. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, showing remarkable drought resistance.

    The large flowers attract pollinators such as butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds, making it a valuable plant for biodiversity. It is also an excellent biomass producer, contributing rich organic matter when used as a green mulch or compost.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight).
    - Well-drained, moderately fertile soil is ideal.
    - Drought-tolerant but benefits from occasional deep watering in dry conditions.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow after the last frost or start indoors and transplant.
    - Cuttings: Can be propagated from semi-hardwood cuttings.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Blooms continuously in warm seasons.
    - Cut flowers for arrangements or seed collection when mature.
  purpose: |-
    Tithonia serves multiple roles in permaculture systems:

    - Pollinator: Attracts butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides nectar and habitat for beneficial insects.
    - Mulcher: Produces abundant biomass for green manure and composting.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Absorbs nutrients and enriches the soil.
    - Border Plant: Used as a natural hedge to define garden spaces.
