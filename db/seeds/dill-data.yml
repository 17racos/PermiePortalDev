  description: |-
    Dill (Anethum graveolens) is an aromatic, feathery-leaved annual herb that grows up to 90 cm (3 feet) tall. It produces delicate, umbrella-shaped clusters of yellow flowers that attract beneficial insects. The entire plant, including leaves, seeds, and flowers, is edible.

    Dill thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic to neutral soil and is commonly used as a culinary and medicinal herb. It self-seeds easily, making it a great addition to herb gardens and food forests.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Grows best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soil.
    - Requires moderate watering; avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow in early spring or late summer; does not transplant well.
    - Self-seeding: Reseeds easily if flowers are left to mature.
    - No division: Best grown from seed rather than division or cuttings.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested once plants reach 20 cm (8 inches) tall.
    - Flowers should be harvested when fully open for best flavor.
    - Seeds are ready when they turn brown and dry on the plant.
