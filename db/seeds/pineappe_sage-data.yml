  description: |-
    Pineapple sage is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and Guatemala, renowned for its vibrant red tubular flowers and foliage that emits a sweet pineapple scent when crushed. Typically reaching heights of 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet), it thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils with a neutral pH. While somewhat drought-tolerant, consistent moisture promotes optimal growth. Propagation is commonly achieved through cuttings or division, as seeds are rare. In regions cooler than USDA Zone 8, it's often grown as an annual or in containers to overwinter indoors. Flowering occurs in late summer to autumn, attracting hummingbirds and butterflies. Harvesting of leaves and flowers can be done throughout the growing season for culinary or medicinal use.
