  description: |-
    Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a tall, aromatic, and feathery-leaved perennial herb that grows up to 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall. It produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small yellow flowers in summer, which attract beneficial insects.

    This plant thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and is highly drought-resistant once established. It is commonly used for its edible bulbs, seeds, and leaves, as well as for medicinal purposes.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun and thrives in warm climates.
    - Requires well-drained, loamy, or sandy soil.
    - Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from occasional deep watering.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow in early spring or fall, as fennel does not transplant well.
    - Self-seeding: Readily reseeds if flower heads are left to mature.
    - No division: Root division is not commonly used for propagation.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested anytime during the growing season.
    - Bulbs should be harvested when they reach 8–10 cm (3–4 inches) in diameter.
    - Seeds are collected in late summer when flower heads dry and turn brown.
  purpose: |-
    Fennel serves multiple functions in a permaculture system:

    - Edible: Bulbs, seeds, and leaves are used in cooking, herbal teas, and natural remedies.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used for digestion, colic relief, and as a mild expectorant.
    - Pollinator: Flowers attract bees, butterflies, and predatory wasps.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides food for swallowtail butterfly larvae.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Extracts minerals such as sulfur and potassium, enriching nearby soil.
    - Border Plant: Used as a visual and functional garden divider.
