  description: |-
    The pomegranate tree is a small deciduous or evergreen tree, depending on the climate, growing up to 20â€“30 feet tall. It has glossy, narrow leaves and striking orange-red flowers that give way to round, leathery fruits containing juicy, jewel-like seeds known as arils. The tree is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soils. Its vibrant flowers and fruits attract pollinators and wildlife.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, the pomegranate tree serves as a multipurpose plant. It provides nutrient-rich edible fruits, attracts pollinators, and offers erosion control with its strong root system. The tree can be used as a border plant or incorporated into food forests as a sub-canopy layer. Its medicinal properties, which include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits, make it a valuable addition to any holistic permaculture design.
