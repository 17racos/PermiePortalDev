  description: |-
    Strawberry plants are low-growing perennials that form rosettes and send out runners. They typically reach a height of 15–30 cm (6–12 inches) and spread widely through stolons. The plant produces white or pink flowers, followed by red, fleshy, and sweet fruits that are widely appreciated.
    Strawberries prefer full sun and well-drained, loamy soils with a slightly acidic pH (5.5–6.5). They require regular watering, but overwatering can lead to root rot. Propagation is usually done through runners, but they can also be grown from seeds. Harvest occurs in late spring to early summer, depending on the variety and region. Fruits are best picked when fully ripe.
  purpose: |-
    Strawberry plants are highly versatile and beneficial in permaculture:
    - Edible: The fruits are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and dietary fiber, making them a valuable food source.
    - Pollinator: Flowers attract bees and other pollinating insects.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Birds and small mammals are drawn to the fruits and plants, contributing to the local ecosystem.
    - Border Plant: Used as an aesthetic and functional border in gardens and permaculture systems.
