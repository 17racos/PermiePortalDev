    Lemon balm is a perennial herb in the mint family, Lamiaceae, known for its lemon-scented leaves and small white to pale pink flowers. It typically grows 1 to 2 feet tall and forms dense colonies through its spreading habit. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and emit a strong lemon aroma when crushed. Lemon balm thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is hardy in USDA zones 4 through 9 and is known for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators, especially bees. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
