  description: |-
    Bee Balm is a perennial herbaceous plant reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. It features square stems, aromatic lance-shaped leaves, and vibrant tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, purple, or white, blooming from midsummer to early fall. Thriving in full sun to partial shade, it prefers moist, well-drained soils rich in organic matter. Regular watering is essential to maintain consistent soil moisture. Propagation is achieved through seed sowing, division, or stem cuttings. Harvesting of leaves and flowers is best done in the morning after dew has dried but before the heat of the day, typically during peak bloom for optimal flavor and potency.
