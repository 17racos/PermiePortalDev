  description: |-
    Ficus carica, commonly known as the fig, is a deciduous tree or large shrub that typically grows between 4 to 10 meters in height. It has smooth, white to gray bark and large, lobed leaves measuring 10â€“20 cm in length and width. The tree produces unique pear-shaped infructescences known as syconia, which house its flowers internally. These syconia mature into sweet, edible fruits ranging from green to purple hues, depending on the variety. Figs thrive in full sun and prefer organically rich, well-drained soils with a neutral to slightly acidic pH. They are drought-tolerant once established but benefit from regular watering during prolonged dry periods. Propagation is commonly achieved through hardwood cuttings taken during the dormant season. In warmer climates, figs can produce two harvests annually: an early crop (breba) in late spring and the main crop in late summer to early autumn. Fruits are best harvested when fully ripe, as they do not continue to ripen once picked.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Produces sweet, nutritious fruits consumed fresh, dried, or used in various culinary dishes.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used for its laxative properties and to treat various ailments.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Fruits attract birds and mammals; flowers (inside the figs) support specialized pollinators like fig wasps.
    - Erosion Control: Deep root systems help stabilize soil on slopes and prevent erosion.
    - Animal Fodder: Leaves and fruits can be used as supplementary feed for livestock.
    - Windbreaker: When planted in rows, fig trees can serve as effective windbreaks due to their dense foliage.
    - Border Plant: Can be used to define property lines or garden sections, providing both aesthetic and functional benefits.
