  description: |-
    Apple trees are deciduous, typically reaching heights of 10 to 30 feet (3 to 9 meters) with a similar spread. They have a rounded canopy with ovate leaves and produce fragrant white to pink blossoms in spring, followed by fruit maturing in late summer to fall. Apple trees require full sun and well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods. Propagation is commonly achieved through grafting to maintain cultivar characteristics. Harvesting times vary by variety but generally occur from late summer to late fall when the fruit is firm and crisp.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, apple trees serve multiple functions:
    - Edible: Provide a reliable source of nutritious fruit for fresh consumption, cooking, and preservation.
    - Medicinal: Apples contain antioxidants and dietary fiber, contributing to overall health.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Flowers attract pollinators; fallen fruit provides food for various animals.
    - Erosion Control: Root systems help stabilize soil, reducing erosion.
    - Pollinator Support: Blossoms offer nectar and pollen for bees and other pollinators.
    - Border Plant: Can define property lines or garden sections.
    - Pest Management: Certain companion plants can be grown nearby to deter pests naturally.
