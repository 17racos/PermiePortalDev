  description: |-
    Longevity Spinach is a low-growing, semi-succulent plant that typically reaches 1–3 feet in height and spreads up to 3–5 feet wide. It features broad, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge and a mild, slightly bitter flavor. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring partial shade to full sun and well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an excellent ground cover, helping to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.
