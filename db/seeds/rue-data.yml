  description: |-
    Rue is a woody perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 60–90 cm (24–36 inches). It has blue-green, feathery leaves and clusters of small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is highly aromatic, with a strong, pungent scent. It prefers full sun and thrives in well-drained, slightly dry soils. Rue is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established. 
    Propagation is best achieved via seeds sown in spring or softwood cuttings taken in late spring. Harvesting of leaves can occur throughout the growing season, but gloves should be worn to prevent skin irritation due to its furanocoumarins.

    Rue serves multiple purposes in permaculture:

    - Pest Management: Repels a variety of pests, including flies, fleas, and beetles, making it a natural companion plant.
    - Border Plant: Its unique appearance and strong scent make it a natural deterrent for grazing animals and a visually appealing garden border.
