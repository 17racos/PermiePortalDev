- name: "Aphids"
  picture: aphids.jpg
  scientific_name: Aphidoidea
  description: "Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that come in various colors, such as green, black, yellow, or pink. They are typically found on the undersides of leaves or on new plant growth. Aphids feed on plant sap, which can weaken plants and cause leaves to curl or yellow."
  characteristics: "Aphids have pear-shaped bodies and are often less than 1/8 inch long. They have long, slender mouthparts designed for piercing plant tissue and sucking out sap. Some species have wings, which they use to migrate to other plants. Aphids excrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which can attract ants and promote sooty mold growth, further harming plants."
  control_methods: "To control aphids organically, start by spraying plants with a strong jet of water to dislodge them. Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs or lacewings to your garden. Apply neem oil, insecticidal soap, or a homemade solution of water and a few drops of dish soap to affected plants. Prevent aphid infestations by encouraging plant health through proper watering, fertilizing, and avoiding excessive nitrogen, which can attract aphids. For severe infestations, remove and destroy heavily infested plant parts."
  natural_enemies: "Ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, hoverfly larvae, and predatory beetles are all natural enemies of aphids and help control their populations in a garden setting."

  picture: spider_mites.jpg
  scientific_name: Tetranychidae
  description: "Spider mites are tiny arachnids, often red, yellow, or green in color, that can be difficult to see without magnification. They are commonly found on the undersides of leaves, where they spin fine webs to protect themselves and their eggs. Spider mites feed on plant sap, causing leaves to develop yellow spots, become mottled, or drop prematurely."
  characteristics: "Spider mites are very small, measuring less than 1 mm in size. They have eight legs and a body shape similar to that of spiders. Their distinctive webbing is often the first sign of their presence. Spider mites thrive in hot, dry conditions and reproduce quickly, with populations exploding in just a few weeks. Their feeding weakens plants, reduces photosynthesis, and can lead to plant death if untreated."
  control_methods: "To organically control spider mites, regularly spray plants with water to remove mites and disrupt their webs. Increase humidity around plants to create an unfavorable environment for them. Apply insecticidal soap, neem oil, or horticultural oils directly to affected areas. Introduce predatory insects like ladybugs or predatory mites to help manage their population. Prevent infestations by regularly inspecting plants, removing infested leaves, and maintaining proper watering and plant care practices."
  natural_enemies: "Predatory mites, ladybugs, lacewing larvae, and minute pirate bugs are natural predators of spider mites and can help control their populations."
