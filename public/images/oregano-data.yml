  description: |-
    Oregano (Origanum vulgare) is a hardy, aromatic perennial herb native to the Mediterranean. It grows in clumps with small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of purple to pink flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is well-suited for dry, well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant once established. Known for its strong, pungent flavor, oregano is a staple in Mediterranean cuisine.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soil.
    - Drought-tolerant once established; requires moderate watering.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow or start indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost.
    - Cuttings: Stem cuttings root easily in water or soil.
    - Division: Established plants can be divided and transplanted.

    ### When to Harvest
