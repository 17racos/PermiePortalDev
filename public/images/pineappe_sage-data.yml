  description: |-
    Pineapple Sage (Salvia elegans) is a perennial herb known for its vibrant red tubular flowers and fragrant foliage that smells like pineapple. It grows as a bushy shrub reaching 1-1.5 meters (3-5 feet) tall and spreads moderately. The plant thrives in warm climates and is commonly grown for its ornamental value, culinary use, and attractiveness to pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.
