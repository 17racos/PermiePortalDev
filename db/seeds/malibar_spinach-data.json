    "description": "Malabar spinach (*Basella alba*) is a tropical, perennial vine native to Asia and Africa, valued for its edible, fleshy leaves and stems. Despite its name, it's not a true spinach but offers a similar taste and texture. The plant is a vigorous climber, reaching up to 10 meters (33 feet) in length. Its glossy, heart-shaped leaves are thick and have a mild, slightly peppery flavor. The succulent stems are green or reddish, depending on the variety, and the plant produces small white to pink flowers in clusters.",
    "purpose": "Malabar spinach is used for culinary purposes, offering a nutritious and unique vegetable option. It has a mild, slightly peppery flavor and when cooked, the leaves have a mucilaginous texture, ideal for thickening soups and stews. It is also valued in traditional medicine, although scientific evidence for medicinal uses is limited.",
    "grow_conditions": "Malabar spinach thrives in hot, humid conditions and prefers temperatures between 21째C to 32째C (70째F to 90째F). It grows best in well-drained, fertile soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0. The plant requires full sun to partial shade and regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist.",
    "companions": "Benefits from being planted with beans, borage, lettuce, spinach, and peas, which provide partial shade and help retain soil moisture.",
    "avoid": "Avoid planting near crops that require full sun and dry conditions, such as succulents or certain herbs like rosemary.",
    "pests": "Common pests include aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Regular monitoring and pest management are needed to maintain healthy plants."
