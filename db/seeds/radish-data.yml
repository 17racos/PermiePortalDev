  description: |-
    Radishes are fast-growing, cool-season annuals known for their crisp, mildly spicy roots. They exhibit a variety of root shapes and colors, from round to elongated and red to white. The plants produce leafy greens arranged in a rosette at the base, which are also edible. Radishes thrive in full sun and prefer well-drained, sandy loam soils with a pH between 6.5 and 7.0. They require consistent moisture to develop tender roots. Propagation is through direct seeding; sow seeds 1–2 cm deep and 2.5 cm apart, thinning to 5–7.5 cm to allow proper root development. Radishes mature quickly, typically within 3–6 weeks, depending on the variety. Harvest roots promptly to prevent them from becoming woody.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Radish roots and greens are consumed raw or cooked, adding a peppery flavor to dishes.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to stimulate appetite and aid digestion; roots have laxative properties.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Accumulates nutrients like sulfur, aiding in soil fertility.
    - Erosion Control: Varieties like Daikon have deep taproots that break up compacted soil, enhancing aeration and reducing erosion.
    - Pest Management: Acts as a trap crop, attracting pests away from main crops; its pungent odor deters certain insects.
