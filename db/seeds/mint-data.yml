    Mint (Mentha spp.) is a fast-growing, aromatic herb known for its spreading growth habit and strong scent. It is a vigorous plant that can quickly take over garden beds if not contained. Mint thrives in various conditions, making it an excellent choice for permaculture gardens.

    The leaves are commonly used in culinary dishes, herbal teas, and medicinal preparations. Mint also attracts pollinators while repelling harmful pests, making it an ideal companion plant.
