  description: |-
    Crimson clover is a cool-season annual legume known for its vibrant red, conical flowers and trifoliate leaves. It typically grows to a height of 20–50 cm 8–20 inches and is commonly used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. It thrives in well-drained soil and can grow in a variety of climates, but it is sensitive to frost. The plant’s dense growth helps to suppress weeds, reduce soil erosion, and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves and flowers are also edible and can be used in salads or as garnishes.
  purpose: |-
    - Nitrogen Fixer: Enriches the soil by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants.
    - Pollinator: Attracts beneficial insects, enhancing biodiversity.
    - Erosion Control: Prevents soil erosion through its dense groundcover.
    - Ground Cover: Suppresses weeds and retains soil moisture.
    - Mulcher: Adds organic matter to the soil, improving soil health.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Mobilizes deep nutrients for other plants to use.
    - Animal Fodder: Provides forage for livestock.
    - Windbreaker: Acts as a natural barrier against wind.
    - Edible: Young leaves and flowers are edible and can be used in cooking.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Attracts wildlife, including birds and insects.
    - Pest Management: Helps manage pests by attracting beneficial insects.
    - Border Plant: Defines garden beds or pathways.
