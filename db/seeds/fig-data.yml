  description: |-
    The fig tree is a deciduous, multi-branched tree or shrub that can reach heights of 3–10 meters (10–33 feet). It has smooth, gray bark and large, lobed leaves that provide a distinctive silhouette. The tree produces unique, pear-shaped fruits known as figs, which are technically inverted flowers. Figs can vary in color from green to deep purple, depending on the variety. The tree thrives in warm, temperate, and subtropical climates and is known for its resilience and ability to grow in a variety of soil types, provided they are well-drained. Fig trees have a deep root system that aids in soil stabilization, making them useful for erosion control.
