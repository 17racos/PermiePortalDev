  description: |-
    Yarrow *Achillea millefolium* is a hardy perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows 2 to 3 feet tall, featuring feathery, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Yarrow is known for its aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, making it a resilient addition to various garden settings. Its deep, fibrous root system aids in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Yarrow is also recognized for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally to treat wounds and as an anti-inflammatory. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
