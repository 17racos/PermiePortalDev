  description: |-
    Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, known for its gray-green, velvety leaves and spikes of tubular flowers that attract pollinators. It typically grows to about 2 feet tall and prefers well-drained, sandy soil with full sun exposure. Sage is drought-tolerant once established and has a strong, distinctive aroma and flavor. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, white, or red, which bloom in the summer and attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
