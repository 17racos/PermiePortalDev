  description: |-
    Moringa oleifera, commonly known as Moringa, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically reaches a height of 10–12 meters (33–39 feet) with a trunk diameter of 45 centimeters (1.5 feet). The tree features feathery, fern-like leaves and produces fragrant white flowers, followed by slender, pendulous seed pods up to 45 centimeters (18 inches) long. Moringa thrives in full sun and well-drained sandy or loamy soils with a pH between 6.3 and 7.0. It requires minimal water once established but benefits from regular watering during prolonged dry periods. Propagation is commonly achieved through seeds or cuttings. Seeds should be planted 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inches) deep in moist soil, while cuttings should be 1–2 meters (3–6.5 feet) long and planted directly into the ground. Harvesting of leaves can commence as early as 6–8 weeks after planting, with regular harvesting promoting bushier growth. Seed pods are typically harvested when they reach full size but are still tender.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: All parts of the Moringa tree are edible, including leaves, pods, seeds, and flowers, providing a rich source of vitamins and minerals.
    - Medicinal: Moringa has been used traditionally to treat various ailments due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
    - Nitrogen Fixer: Enhances soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen.
    - Pollinator: Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
    - Erosion Control: The extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion.
    - Animal Fodder: Leaves and pods serve as nutritious fodder for livestock.
    - Windbreaker: When planted in rows, Moringa trees act as effective windbreaks.
    - Border Plant: Suitable for creating living fences or property boundaries.
    - Pest Management: Certain compounds in Moringa can repel pests, aiding in integrated pest management strategies.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Moringa is considered a valuable dynamic accumulator. Its deep roots pull up nutrients from the soil, which can then be used as mulch or compost to enrich the soil. The leaves are nutrient-dense, providing essential minerals like calcium, potassium, and iron, making them perfect for composting and enhancing soil health.
