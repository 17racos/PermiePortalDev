  description: |-
    Sage (Salvia officinalis) is a hardy, woody-stemmed perennial herb known for its aromatic gray-green leaves and purple-blue flowers. It grows in a bushy, compact form, reaching about 30-60 cm (12-24 inches) in height. Sage is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.

    It has a long history of culinary and medicinal use, particularly for flavoring meats and teas. The plant attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies while also repelling common garden pests.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun (at least 6 hours per day).
    - Requires well-drained, sandy or loamy soil.
    - Drought tolerant once established; water sparingly to prevent root rot.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Slow to germinate; best started indoors before the last frost.
    - Cuttings: Take softwood cuttings in spring or summer and root in moist soil.
    - Division: Older plants can be divided in early spring or fall.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Harvest leaves once the plant is established, typically in its second year.
    - Best harvested in the morning when oils are most concentrated.
    - Flowers can also be harvested for teas or garnishes.
