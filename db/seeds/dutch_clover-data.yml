  description: |-
    Dutch clover is a low-growing perennial herb reaching heights of 8–20 cm (3–8 inches). It features trifoliate leaves with a characteristic white "V" marking and produces small, fragrant white to pinkish flowers from late spring through summer. Thriving in full sun to partial shade, it prefers well-drained, moist soils but is adaptable to various soil types. Propagation is typically achieved through seed sowing in early spring or autumn. Once established, it spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that suppress weeds. Harvesting for fodder or mulch can occur multiple times during the growing season when the plant reaches sufficient biomass.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Young leaves and flowers are edible and can be used in salads or as a cooked green.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties.
    - Nitrogen Fixer: Forms symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching soil fertility.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Flowers attract bees and other pollinators, supporting local biodiversity.
    - Mulcher: Serves as a living mulch, suppressing weeds and retaining soil moisture.
    - Erosion Control: Dense root systems help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.
    - Animal Fodder: Provides nutritious forage for livestock, particularly ruminants.
    - Pollinator: Supports pollinator populations by providing nectar and pollen resources.
    - Border Plant: Can be used to define garden borders and pathways due to its low-growing habit.
    - Pest Management: Attracts beneficial insects that prey on common garden pests.
