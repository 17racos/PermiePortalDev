  description: |-
    Holy Basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) is a highly aromatic, bushy herb that grows between 30–90 cm (1–3 feet) tall. It produces small purple or white flowers that attract bees and other pollinators. The leaves have a strong, clove-like scent and are widely used in Ayurvedic medicine.

    Holy Basil is a heat-loving plant that thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained, fertile soil. It is often grown as a medicinal herb, companion plant, or natural pest deterrent.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun (at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily).
    - Requires well-drained, fertile soil with moderate water needs.
    - Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow after the last frost or start indoors 4–6 weeks before transplanting.
    - Cuttings: Can be propagated from stem cuttings placed in water or soil.
    - Self-seeding: Readily self-seeds in warm climates.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Harvest leaves regularly throughout the growing season for fresh use.
    - Flowers should be pinched off to encourage bushier growth.
    - Entire plants can be harvested before flowering for drying and medicinal use.
