  description: |-
    Pomegranate is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 5–8 meters (16–26 feet) with a spreading, vase-shaped form. It features glossy, dark green leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and red, trumpet-shaped flowers with five petals each. The fruit is a large, spherical berry with a thick, leathery rind encasing numerous juicy, tangy seeds known as arils. Pomegranates thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, exhibiting high drought tolerance once established. They prefer neutral to slightly alkaline soils (pH 6.0–7.5) and are hardy in USDA zones 7 through 11. Propagation is commonly achieved through hardwood cuttings, ensuring true-to-type plants, though they can also be grown from seeds. Harvesting typically occurs in late summer to early fall when the fruit develops a deep red color and produces a metallic sound when tapped. Ripe fruits should be cut from the tree to avoid damage.
