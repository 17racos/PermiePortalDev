  description: |-
    Garlic is a hardy perennial plant, typically grown as an annual for its pungent bulbs composed of multiple cloves encased in a papery sheath. The plant has an upright growth habit, reaching a height of 60–90 cm (24–36 inches). Its long, flat, grass-like leaves grow directly from the base, forming a fan-like arrangement. Garlic thrives in full sun and well-drained, fertile soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It is a heavy feeder, benefiting from the addition of compost or well-rotted manure. Plant individual cloves in the autumn, 5–7.5 cm (2–3 inches) deep and 15–20 cm (6–8 inches) apart, with the pointed end facing up. Mulch the planting area to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Harvest occurs in mid-summer when the lower leaves turn yellow; carefully lift the bulbs and cure them in a dry, airy place for several weeks before storage.
