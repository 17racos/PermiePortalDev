  description: |-
    Dill is an annual herb reaching heights of 0.6 to 1.2 meters (2 to 4 feet) with slender, hollow stems and finely divided, feathery leaves. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Preferring full sun, dill thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic to neutral soils rich in organic matter. It requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but does not tolerate waterlogged conditions. Propagation is typically achieved through direct seeding in the garden after the last frost. Harvesting of leaves can begin when plants are about 25 to 30 centimeters (10 to 12 inches) tall; seeds are harvested when they turn tan or brown.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Both dill leaves and seeds are used to flavor a variety of dishes, including soups, salads, and pickles. The leaves, known as dillweed, are often used fresh, while the seeds serve as a spice.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally, dill has been used to aid digestion and alleviate flatulence. Dill seed tea is sometimes consumed for its soothing effects.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Dill flowers attract beneficial insects such as bees, wasps, and butterflies, including the black swallowtail butterfly, which uses dill as a host plant for its larvae.
    - Pollinator: By attracting pollinators, dill can enhance the productivity of nearby plants.
    - Pest Management: Dill can repel certain pests and attract predatory insects that help control pest populations. However, it may attract aphids and should be monitored accordingly.
    - Border Plant: Its tall, airy foliage makes it suitable for garden borders.
