  description: |-
    Nasturtium is a fast-growing annual plant native to South America. It features round, peltate leaves with a diameter of 3–15 cm (1.2–5.9 inches) and vibrant flowers ranging from yellow to deep red, approximately 2.5–6 cm (1–2.4 inches) in diameter. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, moderately fertile soil. It is drought-tolerant but performs best with regular watering, about twice a week. Propagation is typically done by direct sowing seeds after the last frost; seeds should be planted 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) deep and spaced 25–30 cm (10–12 inches) apart. Germination occurs within 10–14 days. In warmer climates (zones 9–11), nasturtiums can act as short-lived perennials. Flowers and leaves are edible and can be harvested as needed throughout the growing season.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Both leaves and flowers are edible, offering a peppery flavor suitable for salads and garnishes.
    - Medicinal: Rich in vitamin C and possessing antibacterial properties, nasturtiums can boost the immune system and aid in treating infections.
    - Pollinator Attraction: Brightly colored flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators, enhancing garden biodiversity.
    - Wildlife Attraction: Serves as a habitat and food source for beneficial insects.
    - Mulcher: Acts as a living mulch, shading the soil, reducing weed growth, and conserving moisture.
    - Border Plant: Effective as an ornamental border with its trailing habit and vibrant flowers.
    - Pest Management: Functions as a trap crop, luring pests like aphids and cabbage white butterflies away from other plants.
