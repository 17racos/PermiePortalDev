  description: |-
    Longevity Spinach (Gynura procumbens) is a fast-growing, vining perennial green with highly nutritious, tender leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, it is commonly used in traditional medicine and as a food source due to its high antioxidant content and reported health benefits.

    The plant spreads vigorously, making it excellent for ground cover in warm climates. It thrives in a variety of soil conditions but prefers rich, well-drained soil. It is highly adaptable and can be grown in containers, raised beds, or directly in the ground.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers partial shade to full sun.
    - Thrives in warm, humid conditions but can tolerate drier environments with sufficient watering.
    - Requires well-draining, loamy, or sandy soil; does not tolerate waterlogging.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Cuttings: The easiest method; cut stems and root them in water or moist soil.
    - Layering: Allow stems to touch the soil, where they will develop roots naturally.
    - Seeds: Less commonly used as propagation is much faster via cuttings.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested year-round in warm climates.
    - Regular pruning encourages bushier growth and prevents legginess.
    - Young leaves are preferred for the best texture and flavor.
