  description: |-
    Basil is a fragrant herb native to tropical regions of Central Africa and Southeast Asia. It features bright green, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge and can grow up to 2 feet tall. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in summer. Basil thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil and is sensitive to frost. Its aromatic leaves are commonly used in culinary dishes, especially in Italian and Southeast Asian cuisines. Basil also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, enhancing garden biodiversity. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
