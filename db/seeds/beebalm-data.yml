  description: |-
    Bee Balm (Monarda didyma) is a hardy, herbaceous perennial known for its vibrant red, pink, or purple flowers that attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. The plant grows between 60–120 cm (2–4 feet) tall with square stems and aromatic, lance-shaped leaves.

    It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and spreads via rhizomes, forming dense patches over time. The flowers bloom from mid to late summer, providing a long-lasting nectar source. Bee Balm is commonly grown in pollinator gardens, herbal medicine gardens, and as a companion plant in vegetable gardens.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Grows best in rich, well-drained soil with consistent moisture.
    - Moderate water needs; avoid waterlogging to prevent powdery mildew.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Start indoors 8–10 weeks before the last frost or direct sow in spring.
    - Division: Easily propagated by dividing root clumps in early spring or fall.
    - Cuttings: Stem cuttings can be rooted in water or moist soil.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested anytime during the growing season for tea or fresh use.
    - Flowers should be harvested at peak bloom for medicinal or culinary purposes.
    - Regular pruning promotes new growth and extends the flowering season.
