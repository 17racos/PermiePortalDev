  description: |-
    Elderberry is a fast-growing deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of 2 to 6 meters (6 to 20 feet). It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets, each serrated along the edges. In late spring to early summer, it produces large, flat clusters of tiny white or cream-colored flowers, followed by clusters of small, dark purple to black berries in late summer to early autumn. Elderberries thrive in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of soil types, including clay and sandy soils. They prefer full sun to partial shade and are often found in riparian zones, forest edges, and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to sucker from the base make it effective for naturalizing and forming thickets.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Elderberries and flowers are used in culinary applications, including jams, jellies, wines, and syrups. Note that raw berries and other parts of the plant contain compounds that can be toxic if ingested; cooking or processing is necessary to make them safe for consumption.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally, elderberries have been used for their immune-boosting properties and to alleviate cold and flu symptoms. Elderflowers are also used in herbal remedies for their anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while the berries provide food for various bird species and mammals.
    - Erosion Control: Elderberry's extensive root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for controlling erosion on banks and slopes.
    - Windbreaker: When planted in groups, elderberries can serve as a windbreak, protecting other plants and reducing soil desiccation.
    - Pollinator: The abundant flowers provide a nectar source for pollinators, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem.
    - Border Plant: Elderberries can be used as a natural hedge or border plant in permaculture designs, delineating spaces while providing multiple functions.
