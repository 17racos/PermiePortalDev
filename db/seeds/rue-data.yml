  description: |-
    Rue is a woody perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its blue-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. It typically grows up to 2 to 3 feet in height and prefers well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant emits a strong, pungent aroma and contains compounds that can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, rue is valued for its pest-repellent properties, deterring insects such as aphids and fleas, thus aiding in natural pest management. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity. As a border plant, rue can define garden boundaries and protect other plants from pests.
