  description: |-
    Okinawa Spinach (Gynura bicolor) is a fast-growing, hardy perennial green that thrives in warm, humid climates. It features vibrant green leaves with striking purple undersides, making it both ornamental and functional in permaculture systems. The leaves are tender with a mild, slightly nutty flavor and are widely used in Asian cuisine. It is an excellent ground cover plant, helping to suppress weeds while improving soil moisture retention.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers partial shade but tolerates full sun in cooler climates.
    - Requires consistent moisture but does not tolerate waterlogging.
    - Thrives in well-drained, fertile soil with organic matter.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Cuttings: Best propagated through stem cuttings, which root easily in water or soil.
    - Division: Can be divided to establish new plants.
    - Seeds: Rarely propagated by seed due to difficulty in germination.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested continuously as needed once the plant is established.
    - Best harvested in the morning for optimal flavor and texture.
    - Regular harvesting encourages bushier growth.
  purpose: |-
    Okinawa Spinach serves multiple permaculture functions:

    - Edible: Leaves are used raw in salads or cooked in soups and stir-fries.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used in Chinese medicine to support blood circulation and reduce inflammation.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Flowers attract pollinators, including bees and butterflies.
    - Mulcher: Provides abundant organic material for mulching and soil improvement.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Absorbs and stores nutrients, enriching the soil.
    - Erosion Control: Works as an excellent ground cover to prevent soil erosion.
    - Animal Fodder: Leaves are suitable for feeding livestock such as chickens and rabbits.
