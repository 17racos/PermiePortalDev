  description: |-
    Longevity Spinach is a perennial, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It exhibits a trailing or scrambling growth habit, with stems that can extend up to 3 meters (approximately 10 feet) in length. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, measuring 3.5–10 cm (1.4–3.9 inches) in length and 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 inches) in width, with slightly serrated edges. They are fleshy and vibrant green, sometimes displaying a purplish hue on the underside.

    This plant thrives in partial sun to light shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils with a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0. It is not tolerant of drought conditions and benefits from regular watering to maintain consistent soil moisture. Longevity Spinach is best propagated through stem cuttings, which root readily in water or directly in soil. While it can produce yellow-orange flowers, propagation by seed is uncommon due to infrequent seed production.

    Harvesting can commence approximately 30 days after planting. Regularly picking the young, tender leaves encourages bushier growth and ensures a continuous supply. The leaves can be consumed fresh or cooked, making them a versatile addition to various dishes.

  purpose: |-
    - Edible: The leaves are consumed as a vegetable in salads, soups, and stir-fries, offering a mild, slightly earthy flavor.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties, and to support cardiovascular health.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Accumulates nutrients, potentially enriching the soil when used as mulch.
    - Erosion Control: Its spreading habit helps stabilize soil, reducing erosion.
    - Border Plant: Can be used to define garden edges due to its dense, low-growing nature.
