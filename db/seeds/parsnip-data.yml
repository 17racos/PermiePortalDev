  description: |-
    Parsnips are biennial root vegetables grown for their long, tapered, white to cream-colored roots. The plant reaches up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in height if left to flower in its second year. It prefers full sun and fertile, well-drained soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Parsnips require consistent moisture, especially during germination, which can take up to 21 days. Sowing seeds directly into the soil in early spring, approximately 1 cm (0.4 inches) deep and spaced 5–7 cm (2–3 inches) apart, is the most common propagation method. Harvest occurs in late autumn to early winter after frost, which enhances the root's sweetness. Roots are typically 20–30 cm (8–12 inches) long when mature.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: A versatile root vegetable used in soups, stews, roasts, and purees, offering a sweet and nutty flavor.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Extracts nutrients like potassium from deep soil layers, enriching the topsoil when decomposed.
    - Mulcher: Chopped leaves can be used as mulch, adding organic matter to the soil.
    - Pest Management: Attracts beneficial predatory insects such as parasitic wasps when left to flower.
