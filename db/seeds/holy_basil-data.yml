  description: |-
    Holy Basil commonly known as Tulsi, is an aromatic perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm (12-24 inches) with hairy stems and green or purplish leaves that are ovate and slightly toothed. The plant produces purplish or white flowers arranged in close whorls on elongated racemes. Holy Basil thrives in full sun and prefers well-drained, moist, sandy loam soils with a neutral pH. It is sensitive to frost and grows best in warm climates. Propagation is commonly done through seeds, which should be sown after the last frost when soil temperatures are consistently above 21°C (70°F). Germination occurs within 1–2 weeks. Harvesting of leaves can begin once the plant has reached sufficient maturity, typically 40–60 days after sowing. Regular harvesting encourages bushier growth and prolongs the plant's productive period.
