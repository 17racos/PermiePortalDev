  description: |-
    Turmeric is a herbaceous perennial plant that grows to a height of 1–1.5 meters (3–5 feet). It has large, lance-shaped leaves and produces pale yellow to white flowers. The plant's underground rhizomes are the primary harvested parts, valued for their vibrant orange color and strong, earthy flavor. 
    Turmeric thrives in warm, humid climates with temperatures ranging from 20–30°C (68–86°F). It prefers partial to full sun and well-drained, fertile soils with a pH of 4.5–7.5. Regular watering is essential for optimal growth. Propagation is done by planting rhizome sections with at least two buds in spring or early summer. Harvesting occurs 8–10 months after planting when the leaves begin to yellow and die back. Rhizomes are then dug up, cleaned, and cured.

    - Medicinal: Known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, turmeric is used in traditional and modern medicine.
    - Mulcher: Leaves and plant residues can be composted or used as organic mulch.
    - Pest Management: Acts as a natural repellent against nematodes and some soil pests.
