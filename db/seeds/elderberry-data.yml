  description: |-
    Elderberry is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and North America, typically reaching heights of 3–4 meters (10–13 feet). It features pinnate leaves with 5–7 leaflets and produces clusters of small, white to cream-colored flowers in late spring to early summer. These are followed by dark purple to black berries in late summer to early autumn. Elderberries prefer full sun to partial shade and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are tolerant of a range of soil types, including clay and sandy soils. Propagation is commonly achieved through hardwood cuttings taken during dormancy or by sowing seeds after stratification. Harvest flowers when they are fully open, and pick berries when they are fully ripe and dark in color.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Elderberries are used in jams, jellies, syrups, and wines. Note that raw berries and other parts of the plant can be toxic and should be cooked before consumption.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to support immune function and treat colds and flu symptoms. Elderflowers are also used in herbal remedies.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, while berries provide food for birds and other wildlife.
    - Erosion Control: The extensive root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control on banks and slopes.
    - Windbreaker: Can be planted as part of a windbreak due to its dense growth habit.
    - Pollinator: The abundant flowers provide a nectar source for pollinators, supporting biodiversity in the ecosystem.
    - Border Plant: Often used in hedgerows and as a border plant in permaculture designs.
