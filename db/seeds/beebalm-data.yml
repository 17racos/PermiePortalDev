  description: |-
    Bee Balm is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. It features vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, purple, or white, blooming from mid-summer to early fall. The aromatic foliage emits a minty fragrance when crushed. Preferring full sun to partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, Bee Balm is known for its susceptibility to powdery mildew in humid conditions.
