  description: |-
    Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is a perennial, aromatic herb known for its fragrant purple flowers and gray-green foliage. It grows up to 60–90 cm (2–3 feet) tall and is widely cultivated for essential oil production, medicinal uses, and as an ornamental plant.

    This drought-tolerant plant thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It attracts pollinators, repels certain pests, and adds beneficial organic matter to the soil when used as mulch.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Requires full sun with at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
    - Prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soil; does not tolerate heavy clay.
    - Drought-tolerant once established; water sparingly to prevent root rot.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Start indoors 8–10 weeks before the last frost; germination is slow.
    - Cuttings: Softwood cuttings in spring or hardwood cuttings in fall.
    - Division: Established plants can be divided and replanted.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Flowers should be harvested when buds are fully formed but before full bloom for the highest essential oil content.
    - Cut stems early in the morning when oils are most concentrated.
    - Dry in a shaded, well-ventilated area for long-term storage.
  purpose: |-
