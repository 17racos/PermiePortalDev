  description: Lemongrass is a tropical perennial herb native to South Asia and Southeast
    Asia. It features tall, slender, green leaves that emit a strong lemon fragrance
    when crushed. Commonly used in Asian cuisine, it imparts a citrusy flavor to dishes
    and is also utilized in teas and as an essential oil. Beyond its culinary applications,
    lemongrass has been employed in traditional medicine for its potential health
    benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.

    - **Mealybugs**: Small, white, cotton-like insects that can infest the plant.
