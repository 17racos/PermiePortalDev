  description: |-
    Kale (*Brassica oleracea* var. *acephala*) is a hardy, leafy green vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family, which includes cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. It is a non-heading cabbage, meaning it doesn't form a central head. Kale has a rosette of large, frilly or flat leaves that can be green, purple, or bluish-green, depending on the variety. It thrives in cooler climates and can tolerate frost, which often enhances its flavor. Typically grown as an annual, kale can reach heights of 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) and spreads about 1 to 2 feet wide. Its deep taproot helps in accessing nutrients from deeper soil layers.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Kale leaves are highly nutritious and can be eaten raw in salads, cooked, or used in smoothies.
    - Medicinal: Rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as antioxidants, contributing to various health benefits.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies when allowed to bolt.
    - Mulcher: Leaves can be used as mulch to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Accumulates nutrients such as calcium and potassium, enriching the soil when decomposed.
