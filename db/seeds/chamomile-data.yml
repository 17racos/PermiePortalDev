  description: |-
    Chamomile is a low-growing herbaceous plant known for its delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. German Chamomile (*Matricaria chamomilla*) is an annual, while Roman Chamomile (*Chamaemelum nobile*) is a perennial. Both varieties emit a pleasant, apple-like fragrance and thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Chamomile typically reaches heights of 6 to 24 inches (15 to 60 cm) and spreads to form a dense ground cover, making it suitable for suppressing weeds and providing habitat for beneficial insects.
