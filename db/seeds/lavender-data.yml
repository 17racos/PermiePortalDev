  description: |-
    Lavender is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean, characterized by its fragrant, purple-blue flowers and silvery-green foliage. It typically grows 1 to 3 feet tall and thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy soils. Its aromatic oils are released when brushed against or crushed, making it a popular choice for sensory gardens.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, lavender serves multiple functions: its edible flowers are used in culinary dishes and teas; medicinally, it's known for its calming and antiseptic properties; it attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, enhancing biodiversity; as a border plant, it defines garden edges and deters pests with its strong scent; and it contributes to pest management by repelling insects such as mosquitoes and moths.
