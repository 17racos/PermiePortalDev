  description: |-
    Rosemary is a perennial evergreen shrub that typically grows to 1–2 meters (3–6 feet) tall, with aromatic needle-like leaves and woody stems. Native to the Mediterranean, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires moderate watering. 
    Propagation is primarily done via semi-hardwood cuttings, though it can also be grown from seeds with slower results. Harvesting is best done when stems are mature but before flowers bloom, usually in spring or early summer. The leaves, which are the primary edible parts, should be harvested early in the day for maximum essential oil concentration.
