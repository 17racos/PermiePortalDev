  description: |-
    Marigolds are hardy, annual flowers known for their vibrant yellow, orange, and red blooms. They grow to heights of 15–90 cm (6–36 inches) depending on the variety, with bushy, compact growth habits. Marigolds thrive in full sun and prefer well-drained soils with moderate fertility. They are drought-tolerant once established and require minimal maintenance. Seeds are typically sown directly into the soil 6 mm (1/4 inch) deep after the last frost. Germination occurs within 5–7 days, and flowers begin to bloom 45–60 days after planting. Regular deadheading encourages continuous flowering throughout the growing season.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: The petals of certain varieties, such as the Signet Marigold (Tagetes tenuifolia), are used in salads and as garnishes for their citrus-like flavor.
    - Medicinal: Known for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, marigold extracts are used in traditional remedies for skin conditions and wound healing.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Marigolds attract beneficial insects, including bees and butterflies, which aid in pollination.
    - Pest Management: The strong scent of marigolds repels pests like nematodes, aphids, and whiteflies. French Marigolds (Tagetes patula) are particularly effective in reducing nematode populations in the soil.
    - Border Plant: With their striking blooms, marigolds are often used to edge garden beds and pathways, creating a vibrant border.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Marigolds contribute organic matter to the soil, improving fertility when incorporated as green manure.
