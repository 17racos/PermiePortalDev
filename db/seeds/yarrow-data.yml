  description: |-
    Yarrow is a hardy, herbaceous perennial that grows to a height of 0.3–1 meter (1–3 feet). It features finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flowers that bloom in white, pink, or yellow from late spring to early fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-drained soils of moderate fertility, preferring a pH between 4.5 and 8.0.
    Propagation is easily done through division, cuttings, or seeds. Seeds germinate in 7–14 days when planted in spring. Harvesting of flowers and leaves can be done throughout the growing season for use in teas, tinctures, or dried arrangements.
