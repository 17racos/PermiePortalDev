  description: |-
    The Pomegranate Tree (Punica granatum) is a deciduous fruit-bearing shrub or small tree that grows up to 3-6 meters (10-20 feet) tall. It is known for its bright red flowers, dense foliage, and round fruits filled with juicy, edible seeds. Pomegranates thrive in warm, arid, and semi-arid climates with well-drained soil and plenty of sun.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Requires full sun for optimal fruit production.
    - Prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.
    - Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular deep watering during fruiting.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - **Seeds**: Can be grown from seeds but may take several years to produce fruit.
    - **Cuttings**: Hardwood cuttings are the preferred method for propagation.
    - **Layering**: Air layering can be used for faster and more reliable propagation.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Fruits ripen in late summer to early fall, typically 5-7 months after flowering.
    - Harvest when the skin turns deep red or yellowish-red and produces a metallic sound when tapped.
  purpose: |-
    The Pomegranate Tree serves multiple functions in a permaculture system:

    - Edible: The fruit is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, consumed fresh, as juice, or in cooking.
    - Medicinal: Used in traditional medicine for digestive health, anti-inflammatory properties, and immune support.
    - Pollinator: The bright red flowers attract bees and hummingbirds, increasing pollination in the garden.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides food and shelter for birds and beneficial insects.
    - Windbreaker: Acts as a wind-resistant hedge in warm climates.
    - Erosion Control: Deep root system stabilizes soil, making it useful for slopes and degraded land.
    - Border Plant: Can be used as a decorative and productive hedge.
