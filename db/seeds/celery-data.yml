  description: |-
    Celery is a biennial plant commonly cultivated as an annual for its crisp, fibrous stalks. It features pinnate, finely divided leaves and can reach a height of 40–60 cm (16–24 inches). In its second year, celery produces clusters of small, creamy-white flowers arranged in dense umbels. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers fertile, well-draining loamy soil with high organic matter content. Optimal soil pH ranges from 6.0 to 7.0. Celery requires consistent moisture; therefore, regular watering is essential to maintain soil moisture without waterlogging. Propagation is typically achieved by sowing seeds indoors 10–12 weeks before the last expected frost date. Sow seeds 0.5 cm (¼ inch) deep in seed trays, and transplant seedlings outdoors after hardening off, spacing them 20–25 cm (8–10 inches) apart in rows 30 cm (12 inches) apart. Harvesting usually occurs 17–18 weeks after planting, when stalks are firm and reach at least 15–20 cm (6–8 inches) in length.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, celery serves multiple functions:
    - Edible: Provides nutritious stalks rich in vitamins K, C, and folate, suitable for fresh consumption, cooking, and preservation.
    - Medicinal: Contains compounds with anti-inflammatory properties; traditionally used to support digestion and reduce blood pressure.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Its flowers attract beneficial insects, including pollinators and predatory species that help control pests.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Accumulates minerals such as potassium and calcium, enhancing soil fertility when plant residues decompose.
    - Erosion Control: The fibrous root system helps bind soil, reducing erosion and improving soil structure.
    - Border Plant: Can be used to define garden beds and pathways, contributing to garden aesthetics.
    - Pest Management: When interplanted with crops like cabbage, it can repel pests such as the cabbage white butterfly.
