  description: |-
    Garlic is a hardy perennial plant known for its culinary and medicinal uses. It typically grows 2 to 3 feet tall, featuring long, slender, green leaves and a central flowering stalk that produces a spherical cluster of small, white to purple flowers. The plant forms a bulb underground, composed of multiple cloves encased in a papery sheath. Garlic is renowned for its pungent aroma and flavor, which intensifies when crushed or chopped. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and requires full sun exposure. Garlic is typically planted in the fall and harvested in mid-summer. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
