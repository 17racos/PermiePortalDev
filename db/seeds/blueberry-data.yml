  description: |-
    Blueberries are deciduous shrubs ranging from 1 to 12 feet in height, depending on the species. They have simple, elliptical leaves and produce clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in spring, followed by blue to purple berries in summer. Blueberries require full sun to partial shade and thrive in well-drained, acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 5.5. Consistent moisture is essential, especially during fruit development. Propagation is typically achieved through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer, or by dividing established plants during dormancy. Harvesting occurs when berries are fully ripe, usually from mid to late summer, depending on the variety and climate.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, blueberries serve multiple functions:
    - Edible: Provide nutrient-rich fruits high in antioxidants, vitamins, and fiber.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Flowers attract pollinators like bees; fruits are a food source for birds and mammals.
    - Erosion Control: Dense root systems help stabilize soil, preventing erosion on slopes and embankments.
    - Border Plant: Can be used to define garden boundaries or create edible hedges.
    - Pollinator Support: Early-season flowers offer nectar and pollen for pollinators emerging in spring.
