  description: |-
    Pear trees are deciduous trees that can grow up to 12 meters (40 feet) tall, although dwarf varieties are smaller, reaching around 3–6 meters (10–20 feet). The trees feature glossy green leaves and produce fragrant white blossoms in spring. Pears are known for their sweet and juicy fruits, which are harvested in late summer to early autumn. The trees prefer full sun and well-drained loamy soils with a pH of 6.0–7.5. They require consistent watering, especially during dry periods, and benefit from mulching to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Propagation is typically achieved through grafting onto compatible rootstocks, although seeds can be used for wild varieties. Harvesting pears is best done when the fruit is firm and allowed to ripen off the tree for optimal flavor and texture.
