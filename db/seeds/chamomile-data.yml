  description: |-
    Chamomile is an annual herbaceous plant reaching heights of 15–60 cm (6–24 inches). It features finely divided, feathery leaves and daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a yellow, conical, and hollow receptacle. The plant emits a pleasant, apple-like fragrance. Chamomile thrives in full sun and well-drained, moderately fertile soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during prolonged dry periods. Propagation is typically achieved by direct sowing seeds in early spring; seeds should be surface-sown and lightly pressed into the soil, as they require light for germination. Germination occurs within 7–14 days under optimal conditions. Flowering begins approximately 6–8 weeks after germination, and harvesting of the flowers is best done in the morning after the dew has dried but before the heat of the day, when essential oil content is at its peak. Regular harvesting encourages further blooming throughout the growing season.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, chamomile serves multiple functions:
    - Edible: The flowers are commonly used to make herbal teas with calming effects.
    - Medicinal: Chamomile possesses anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and sedative properties, traditionally used to treat ailments such as insomnia, digestive issues, and skin irritations.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The flowers attract beneficial insects, including pollinators like bees and predatory insects that help control pest populations.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Chamomile accumulates essential minerals, particularly calcium and potassium, which can enrich the soil when the plant decomposes.
    - Pest Management: Its presence can deter certain pests, and it is believed to have antifungal properties that may benefit neighboring plants.
