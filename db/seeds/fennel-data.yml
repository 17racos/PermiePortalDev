  description: |-
    Fennel is a hardy perennial herb native to the Mediterranean but now cultivated worldwide. It features feathery, bluish-green leaves, hollow stems, and yellow umbrella-like flower clusters. The plant emits a distinct anise or licorice-like aroma and flavor. Fennel thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, preferring sandy or loamy substrates. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during prolonged dry periods. Propagation is typically achieved through direct sowing of seeds in early spring after the last frost, with seedlings thinned to about 30 cm (12 inches) apart. The bulbs, which are actually swollen leaf bases, are ready for harvest approximately 90 days after planting, just before the plant flowers. Leaves and seeds can be harvested as needed; seeds are best collected when they turn brown and dry on the plant.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: All parts of fennel are edible. The bulbs are consumed as a vegetable, leaves as herbs, and seeds as spices. The plant imparts a mild licorice flavor to dishes.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to aid digestion, reduce bloating, and as a remedy for respiratory ailments.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Fennel flowers attract beneficial insects, including bees, parasitic wasps, and hoverflies, enhancing pollination and pest control in the garden.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Fennel accumulates minerals like sulfur and potassium, enriching the soil when plant residues decompose.
    - Mulcher: The plant's biomass can be used as mulch to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.
    - Pest Management: By attracting predatory insects, fennel helps manage pest populations naturally.
