  description: |-
    Oregano is a hardy perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to heights of 20–80 cm (8–31 inches) and spreads to a similar width. The plant has small, aromatic leaves and produces tiny purple or pink flowers in clusters during summer. Oregano thrives in full sun and well-drained soils with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering. Propagation is achieved through seeds, cuttings, or division. Seeds should be sown 6 mm (0.25 inches) deep and kept moist until germination occurs, typically within 7–14 days. Leaves can be harvested once the plant is well-established, usually 8–10 weeks after planting. Harvesting just before flowering ensures the highest essential oil content.
