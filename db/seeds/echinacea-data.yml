  description: |-
    Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as Purple Coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern and central North America. It typically grows to a height of 60–120 cm (2–4 feet) and features large, daisy-like flowers with a prominent central cone surrounded by pink to purple petals. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, displaying drought tolerance once established. Propagation is commonly achieved through seed stratification or division of clumps in spring or autumn. Blooming occurs from summer into autumn, and leaving some seed heads can attract birds and allow for self-sowing.
