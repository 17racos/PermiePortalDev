  description: |-
    Sage is a hardy, woody perennial that typically grows 30–60 cm (12–24 inches) in height. It features gray-green, aromatic leaves with a slightly velvety texture and produces spiky blue, purple, or lavender flowers in late spring or early summer. 
    Sage thrives in full sun and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils with moderate watering needs. It is drought-tolerant once established. Propagation can be done via seeds, cuttings, or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. Leaves can be harvested year-round but are best when picked fresh during the active growing season.
