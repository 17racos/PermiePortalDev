    Echinacea, commonly known as Purple Coneflower, is a hardy perennial native to North America. It features large, daisy-like flowers with purple petals surrounding a prominent, spiky central cone. The plant typically grows up to 4 feet tall and thrives in well-drained soils under full sun. Its long blooming period and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes.
