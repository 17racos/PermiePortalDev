  description: |-
    Tithonia, commonly known as Mexican sunflower, is a fast-growing, multi-stemmed perennial shrub that can reach heights of 2–3 meters (6.5–10 feet). It features large, lobed leaves and produces vibrant orange to yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom year-round in warm climates. 
    The plant thrives in full sun and prefers well-drained soils with moderate fertility. It is drought-tolerant once established and grows well in tropical and subtropical climates. Propagation is done through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method. Tithonia is typically used as a "cut and carry" crop for its biomass and nutrient-rich leaves.
  purpose: |-
    Tithonia is a versatile plant in permaculture, offering the following benefits:
    - Pollinator: Its bright flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides food and habitat for beneficial insects and birds.
    - Mulcher: Produces significant biomass that can be chopped and used as mulch to enrich the soil.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Leaves and stems accumulate nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium, which are released when used as compost or mulch.
    - Erosion Control: Dense root systems stabilize the soil on slopes and prevent erosion.
    - Animal Fodder: Tithonia is also used as livestock fodder in some permaculture systems. Its leaves are rich in nutrients and can be fed to animals, particularly goats and cattle. However, it should be used in moderation as it can be toxic in large quantities.
