  description: |-
    Thyme is a low-growing, woody perennial herb that typically reaches 15–30 cm (6–12 inches) in height. It has small, aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring and summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, thyme thrives in full sun and well-drained, sandy, or rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering.
    Propagation can be done through seeds, cuttings, or division. Seeds are slow to germinate, typically taking 2–3 weeks. Cuttings or division is faster and more reliable. Leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season, and the best flavor is achieved just before flowering.
