  description: |-
    Okinawa Spinach is a dense, low-growing perennial reaching up to 70 cm (27.5 inches) in height. Its shiny leaves are dark green on top with vibrant purple undersides, making it an attractive addition to gardens. The plant produces small orange flowers that can attract beneficial insects. Thriving in warm, humid conditions, it prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained, fertile soil with ample organic matter. Regular watering is essential, as it is not drought-tolerant. Propagation is typically done through cuttings; stems of 10–20 cm (4–8 inches) can be rooted in water or moist soil. Harvesting can begin once the plant is established, with young leaves and shoots being the most tender and flavorful. Continuous harvesting encourages bushier growth. In frost-free climates, it can provide greens year-round.
