  description: |-
    The Pear Tree (Pyrus communis) is a deciduous fruit tree known for its sweet and juicy fruits. It grows between 4.5-12 meters (15-40 feet) tall, with a rounded crown and upright branches. Blossoms appear in early spring, providing nectar for pollinators. Fruits mature in late summer to fall and are rich in fiber and vitamins.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun for optimal fruit production.
    - Requires well-draining, loamy soil with moderate moisture.
    - Deep watering encourages strong root growth.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Grafting: Commonly propagated through grafting onto rootstocks.
    - Seed: Can be grown from seed, but may not produce true-to-type fruit.
    - Cutting: Hardwood cuttings can be rooted with proper care.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Harvest season varies from late summer to early fall.
    - Pears should be picked when firm and ripened off the tree.
    - Store in a cool place to extend shelf life.

    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides food and shelter for birds, pollinators, and beneficial insects.
    - Windbreaker: Can be planted in rows to reduce wind erosion.
    - Border Plant: Useful for orchard boundaries or hedgerows.
    - Erosion Control: Its roots help stabilize soil on slopes.
