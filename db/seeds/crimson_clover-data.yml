  description: |-
    Crimson clover is an upright annual herb that grows to 20–50 cm (8–20 inches) tall, unbranched or branched only at the base. The leaves are trifoliate with a long petiole; each leaflet is hairy, measuring 8–16 mm across, with a truncated or bilobed apex. The plant produces rich red or crimson flowers throughout the spring and summer, arranged in elongated spike inflorescences 3–5 cm tall and 1.5 cm broad. Individual flowers are up to 10–13 mm long and have five petals. The plant thrives in full sun and prefers well-drained, sandy loam soils. It requires moderate water and is drought-tolerant once established. Propagation is typically through seed, sown in late summer or early autumn. Seeds should be planted at a depth of 6–12 mm (0.25–0.5 inches). In mild winter areas, seeds germinate with the first rains of late summer or autumn, and plants grow through the winter, blooming in late spring. Harvesting for forage should occur when flowers are in full bloom to maximize nutritional value.
  purpose: |-
    - Nitrogen Fixer: As a legume, crimson clover forms symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, fixing atmospheric nitrogen into the soil, enhancing fertility for subsequent crops.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The abundant nectar-rich flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, supporting local ecosystems. 
    - Erosion Control: Its dense root system stabilizes soil, reducing erosion, making it suitable for cover cropping and roadside planting.
    - Animal Fodder: Crimson clover is widely grown as a protein-rich forage crop for livestock and is suitable for hay production.
    - Pollinator: The showy, deep red blossoms produce abundant nectar, attracting various types of bees and other pollinators.
    - Mulcher: When used as a cover crop, it can be mowed or incorporated into the soil, providing organic matter and acting as a natural mulch.
    - Border Plant: Can be used to define pathways.
