  description: |-
    Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) is a bushy, aromatic herb that grows up to 90 cm (3 feet) tall. It has bright green, oval-shaped, serrated leaves with a strong lemon scent. The small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer and attract bees and other beneficial pollinators.

    This plant thrives in a variety of soils but prefers moist, well-drained, fertile conditions. It spreads easily by seed and root division, making it an excellent companion plant but also potentially invasive if not managed.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun to partial shade.
    - Requires well-drained, fertile soil with moderate moisture.
    - Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from consistent watering.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Start indoors 6â€“8 weeks before last frost or direct sow in spring.
    - Cuttings: Root cuttings in water or soil.
    - Division: Established plants can be divided and replanted.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season for fresh use.
    - Best harvested in the morning before flowering for maximum essential oil concentration.
    - Can be dried or used fresh for tea, tinctures, and culinary applications.
