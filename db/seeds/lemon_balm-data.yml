  description: |-
    Lemon balm is a perennial herbaceous plant in the mint family, growing to about 45–60 cm (18–24 inches) in height. It has heart-shaped, deeply veined leaves with scalloped edges that emit a mild lemon scent when crushed. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in summer, attracting bees and other pollinators. Lemon balm thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained, humus-rich soils with a pH between 6 and 7.5. It is hardy in USDA zones 3 through 10. Propagation is typically done by seed, cuttings, or division. Seeds require light and a minimum temperature of 20°C (68°F) to germinate and may benefit from a two-week stratification period to enhance germination rates. Harvesting of leaves can begin once the plant reaches about 20 cm (8 inches) in height, with peak flavor just before flowering. Regular harvesting encourages bushier growth and prevents legginess.
