  description: |-
    Lemongrass is a tropical, clump-forming perennial grass that can reach heights of 1.5 meters (5 feet) and widths of up to 1 meter (3 feet). It features long, slender, and slightly sharp-edged leaves with a strong lemon aroma. Preferring full sun and well-draining soil, lemongrass thrives in temperatures above 20°C (68°F) and is sensitive to frost. Propagation is typically achieved through division of established clumps. Harvesting involves cutting stalks close to the base; new growth follows after harvesting. Regular watering is essential, especially in dry conditions, but the plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: The stalks and leaves are used in culinary dishes, especially in Southeast Asian cuisine, imparting a citrus flavor to soups, curries, and teas.
    - Medicinal: Lemongrass has anti-fungal and calming properties; teas made from its leaves can aid digestion and may help lower cholesterol levels.
    - Pest Management: Its strong scent deters pests like aphids and whiteflies, making it a beneficial companion plant in gardens.
    - Mulcher: The leaves can be harvested and used as mulch, contributing to soil health and moisture retention.
    - Erosion Control: The plant's clumping roots help prevent soil erosion, especially on slopes.
