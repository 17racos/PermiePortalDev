  description: |-
    Thyme is a low-growing, aromatic perennial herb with woody stems and small, fragrant leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an excellent choice for borders, rock gardens, and companion planting. The plant produces small purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

    This hardy herb is drought-tolerant and adapts well to poor soils, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens. Thyme has antimicrobial properties and is commonly used in culinary dishes, herbal teas, and natural medicine.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun (6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily).
    - Thrives in dry, well-drained sandy or loamy soil.
    - Drought-tolerant; requires minimal watering once established.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - **Seeds**: Sow indoors in early spring or direct sow after the last frost.
    - **Cuttings**: Take softwood cuttings in spring and root in moist soil.
    - **Division**: Separate mature plants in early spring or fall.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Harvest leaves throughout the growing season.
    - Best flavor is achieved just before flowering.
    - Cut stems and dry them for long-term storage.
