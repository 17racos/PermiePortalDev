    Pear trees are deciduous and can reach heights of 30 to 60 feet, with a spread of 20 to 40 feet. They have a pyramidal to rounded crown and are known for their glossy green leaves and white to pinkish spring blossoms. The trees produce sweet, bell-shaped fruits that vary in color from green to yellow or red when ripe. Pears prefer well-drained loamy soils and full sun exposure. They are unique for their early spring blooms and the distinctive, sweet flavor of their fruit.
