  description: |-
    Marigold (Tagetes spp.) is a hardy, fast-growing flowering plant known for its bright yellow, orange, and red blossoms. It is commonly used in gardens for pest control and soil improvement. Marigolds are easy to grow, requiring minimal maintenance, and they bloom profusely throughout the growing season.

    The plant is particularly valued in companion planting, as it helps repel nematodes, aphids, and other garden pests. It thrives in garden beds, borders, and containers, adding vibrant color while also benefiting the surrounding plants.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but can tolerate partial shade.
    - Requires well-drained soil; thrives in loamy or sandy soil.
    - Moderate watering needs; avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Easily grown from seeds; sow directly in soil after the last frost.
    - Transplants: Can be started indoors and transplanted once seedlings are established.
    - Cuttings: Some varieties can be propagated from cuttings.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Flowers can be harvested once fully bloomed for medicinal or ornamental uses.
    - Regular deadheading promotes continuous blooming.
    - Collect seeds from dried flower heads at the end of the growing season for future planting.
