  description: |-
    Sunflowers are annual plants that can grow to heights ranging from 1.5–3.5 meters (5–12 feet), depending on the variety. They have thick, rough stems, large, heart-shaped leaves, and iconic yellow petals surrounding a dark central disk. Sunflowers thrive in full sun and are drought-tolerant, although they grow best with moderate watering. They prefer well-drained, nutrient-rich soils with a neutral to slightly acidic pH (6.0–7.5). 
    Propagation is done through direct seeding in spring after the last frost. Seeds germinate in 7–10 days, and flowers bloom in summer. Harvesting can occur when the seed heads turn brown, and seeds are firm and fully developed.
  purpose: |-
    Sunflowers offer multiple benefits in permaculture:
    - Edible: Seeds are rich in protein, healthy fats, and vitamins, making them a valuable food source for humans and animals.
    - Medicinal: Traditionally used to treat respiratory issues and as a mild diuretic.
    - Pollinator: Flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Seeds provide food for birds and small mammals, while the plants offer habitat.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Deep taproots pull nutrients like phosphorus and potassium from the soil, enriching the topsoil when decomposed.
    - Mulcher: Stalks and leaves can be composted or used as organic mulch.
    - Border Plant: Serves as a natural fence or windbreak, while adding beauty to the landscape.
