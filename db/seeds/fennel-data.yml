  description: |-
    Fennel is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its feathery, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. It can grow up to 5 feet tall and thrives in well-drained soils under full sun. The plant has a distinct anise-like flavor, and all parts—including the bulb, leaves, and seeds—are edible. Fennel is known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of certain other plants.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, fennel serves multiple purposes: its edible parts are used in various culinary dishes; medicinally, it has been traditionally used to aid digestion and relieve bloating; it attracts beneficial wildlife, including pollinators like bees and butterflies, enhancing biodiversity; as a dynamic accumulator, it draws up nutrients from deep soil layers, enriching the topsoil; and its strong aroma can help in pest management by deterring certain insects.
