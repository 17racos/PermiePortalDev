  description: Strawberries are low-growing perennials that produce small, sweet red
    fruit. The plants are well known for their ability to produce fruit quickly, making
    them a popular choice for home gardens and commercial farms alike. They grow in
    a rosette pattern, with leaves that are serrated and green, and produce runners
    that can spread to form new plants. The fruits are highly nutritious, packed with
    vitamin C, antioxidants, and fiber.
  purpose: Strawberries serve both as a highly nutritious food crop and as a soil
    cover, preventing erosion. They are also attractive to pollinators and beneficial
    insects. Strawberries can be used in culinary dishes, juices, desserts, and preserves.
