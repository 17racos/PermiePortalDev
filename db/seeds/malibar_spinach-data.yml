  description: |-
    Malabar spinach is a fast-growing, tropical perennial vine known for its lush, glossy, and succulent leaves. It can reach lengths of up to 10 meters (approximately 33 feet) when provided with adequate support. The plant thrives in hot, humid climates and is frost-sensitive, making it suitable for USDA hardiness zones 10 and 11. It prefers full sun but can tolerate partial shade, which may result in larger leaves. Malabar spinach requires consistent moisture to prevent premature flowering, which can cause the leaves to become bitter. It grows well in moist, fertile soils rich in organic matter, with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.8. Propagation is typically done through seeds or stem cuttings. Seeds should be sown directly into the soil at a depth of 10 mm (0.4 inches) and spaced 20 cm (8 inches) apart. Germination occurs within 10 to 21 days. Regular harvesting of the tender leaves and stems encourages new growth. Leaves can be harvested once the plant is well-established, usually within 55 to 70 days after planting.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Malabar spinach is a nutritious leafy green, rich in vitamins A and C, iron, and calcium. It can be eaten raw in salads or cooked in soups, stews, and stir-fries. Unlike common spinach, it thrives in hot weather, providing a continuous supply of greens during warmer months.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The plant's flowers and berries attract pollinators such as bees, enhancing biodiversity in the garden.
    - Border Plant: Its vigorous growth and attractive foliage make it suitable for use as a living border or screen when trellised.
