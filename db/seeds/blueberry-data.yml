  description: |-
    Blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) is a deciduous or evergreen shrub, depending on the variety, known for its small, nutrient-rich blue berries. The plant typically grows between 30 cm–2.5 meters (1–8 feet) tall, with bell-shaped white or pink flowers in spring that develop into edible berries by summer.

    Blueberries require acidic soil (pH 4.5–5.5) and prefer well-drained, sandy, or loamy soils rich in organic matter. They thrive in temperate climates and require chilling hours to produce fruit, though some varieties are adapted to warmer climates. They are commonly grown in gardens, orchards, and food forests.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Requires consistently moist, well-drained soil high in organic matter.
    - Sensitive to drought; mulch helps retain soil moisture.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Can be grown from seed but takes several years to bear fruit.
    - Cuttings: Hardwood and softwood cuttings root well in moist soil.
    - Layering: Burying a low branch encourages rooting and new plant growth.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Berries ripen in mid to late summer, depending on the variety.
    - Ripe berries turn deep blue and easily detach from the stem.
    - Harvest frequently to encourage continued fruiting.
  purpose: |-
    Blueberries serve multiple functions in a permaculture system:

    - Edible: Fruits are consumed fresh, dried, or processed into jams, juices, and desserts.
    - Medicinal: Rich in antioxidants, supports brain health, and has anti-inflammatory properties.
    - Pollinator: Flowers attract bees and other beneficial pollinators.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides food for birds, mammals, and beneficial insects.
    - Mulcher: Leaves and pruned branches decompose, improving soil quality.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Accumulates nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus, enriching the surrounding soil.
    - Erosion Control: Deep root systems help stabilize soil, especially on slopes.
    - Border Plant: Works well in hedgerows, edible landscapes, and orchard understories.
