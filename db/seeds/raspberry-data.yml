  description: |-
    Raspberries are deciduous, perennial shrubs known for their delicious red berries. They typically reach heights of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6.5 feet) and spread via underground runners. The canes are biennial, with first-year canes (primocanes) being green and vegetative, while second-year canes (floricanes) become woody and bear fruit. Raspberries prefer full sun but can tolerate partial shade, thriving in well-drained, slightly acidic soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Regular watering is essential, especially during fruiting, to maintain consistent soil moisture. Propagation is commonly achieved through transplanting one-year-old seedlings or by allowing the plant to spread naturally via runners. Harvesting typically occurs from June to October, depending on the variety, when berries are fully colored and easily detach from the receptacle.
  purpose: |-
    - Edible: Raspberries provide a nutritious and delicious fruit, rich in vitamins and antioxidants, making them a valuable addition to a permaculture food forest.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The berries attract birds and other wildlife, supporting local biodiversity.
    - Erosion Control: The extensive root system helps stabilize soil, preventing erosion on slopes and embankments.
    - Border Plant: When planted densely, raspberries can serve as a living fence or border, deterring foot traffic with their thorny canes.
