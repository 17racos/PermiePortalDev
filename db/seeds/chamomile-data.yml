  description: |-
    Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla and Chamaemelum nobile) is a small herbaceous plant known for its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. It grows between 15–60 cm (6–24 inches) tall, depending on the variety, and emits a sweet, apple-like fragrance.

    German Chamomile is an annual that self-seeds easily, while Roman Chamomile is a low-growing perennial. Both varieties thrive in well-drained, sandy, or loamy soils and tolerate drought conditions once established. Chamomile attracts pollinators and beneficial insects while repelling certain pests.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Grows best in well-drained, light, and sandy soils.
    - Requires moderate watering; drought-tolerant once established.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow in early spring; does not require deep planting.
    - Division: Roman Chamomile can be divided in spring or fall.
    - Self-seeding: German Chamomile reseeds naturally and returns yearly.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Flowers are harvested when fully open, typically in late spring to early summer.
    - Regular harvesting encourages continuous blooming.
    - Dry flowers in a well-ventilated area for medicinal and culinary use.
