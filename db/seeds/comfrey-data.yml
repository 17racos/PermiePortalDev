  description: |-
    Comfrey is a robust perennial herb that can grow up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) in height. It features large, hairy leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue, pink, or white. The plant has a deep taproot system, extending up to 3 meters (10 feet) into the soil, allowing it to access nutrients from deep layers. Comfrey thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. It is drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering. Propagation is typically achieved through root cuttings or crown divisions, as seed propagation is unreliable due to low germination rates. Harvesting of leaves can begin in the second year, with multiple cuts per growing season; leaves are best harvested when they reach about 60 cm (24 inches) in length.
  purpose: |-
    In permaculture, comfrey serves multiple functions:
    - Pioneer Plant: Comfrey is often used in permaculture systems as a pioneer plant to establish healthy soil and improve the ecosystem by adding nutrients back into the soil.
    - Comfrey as a Green Manure: Comfrey can be grown and turned back into the soil to add organic matter and nutrients, improving soil health and fertility over time.
    - Edible: While not commonly consumed due to potential toxicity, comfrey has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a tea.
    - Medicinal: Known as 'knitbone,' comfrey contains allantoin, promoting cell regeneration and traditionally used for healing wounds and bone fractures. Topical applications are common, but internal use is discouraged due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Its flowers are rich in nectar, attracting pollinators such as bees and beneficial insects.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Comfrey's deep roots draw up nutrients like potassium, calcium, and phosphorus, enriching the soil when its leaves decompose.
    - Mulcher: The nutrient-rich leaves decompose rapidly, making excellent mulch to suppress weeds and improve soil fertility.
    - Animal Fodder: Comfrey has been used as livestock feed due to its high protein content; however, caution is advised because of potential toxicity.
    - Pollinator: The plant's abundant flowers provide a reliable nectar source for pollinating insects throughout the growing season.
    - Border Plant: Comfrey can be used to create natural borders or barriers in garden landscapes due to its dense growth habit.
