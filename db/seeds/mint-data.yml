  description: |-
    Mint is a hardy perennial herb known for its aromatic leaves and vigorous growth. It typically reaches heights of 30–90 cm (1–3 feet) and spreads rapidly via underground rhizomes. The plant features square stems and serrated, fragrant leaves, with small flowers ranging from white to purple. Mint thrives in moist, well-drained soils rich in organic matter and prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun. It requires consistent moisture, especially during warmer months. To propagate, take stem cuttings of 10–15 cm (4–6 inches) in length and root them in water or moist soil. Harvesting can begin once the plant has multiple stems that are 15–20 cm (6–8 inches) long, ideally before flowering to capture peak flavor. Regular harvesting encourages bushier growth and prevents the plant from becoming leggy. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
