  description: |-
    Mulberry trees are fast-growing deciduous plants known for their sweet, blackberry-like fruits. They can reach heights of 6–15 meters (20–50 feet), with a spreading canopy that provides ample shade. The leaves are typically broad and serrated, varying in shape among species. Mulberries thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, preferring slightly acidic to neutral pH levels. They are drought-tolerant once established but benefit from regular watering during dry spells. Propagation is commonly achieved through hardwood cuttings taken during winter dormancy or by seed, though cuttings ensure the preservation of specific cultivars. Fruits ripen in late spring to early summer and should be harvested promptly to prevent loss to birds and ensure peak flavor.

    - Edible: Mulberries produce abundant, sweet fruits enjoyed fresh or used in jams, wines, and desserts.
    - Medicinal: Traditional uses include treatments for digestive issues and as a source of antioxidants.
    - Wildlife Attractor: The fruits attract various bird species, supporting local biodiversity.
    - Animal Fodder: Leaves serve as nutritious fodder for livestock, including rabbits and goats.
    - Windbreaker: When planted in rows, mulberries can function as effective windbreaks due to their dense foliage.
