  description: |-
    Yarrow is a hardy perennial herb that grows up to 0.6–1 m (2–3 feet) tall. It features feathery, aromatic, finely divided leaves and small white, yellow, pink, or red flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. Yarrow is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, dry soils, making it an excellent low-maintenance plant for permaculture designs.

    The plant spreads through underground rhizomes and self-seeding, forming dense patches over time. It is well known for its role in attracting beneficial insects and acting as a living mulch.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers **full sun** (6+ hours of sunlight).
    - Requires **well-drained soil**, tolerates sandy and rocky conditions.
    - Drought-resistant but benefits from occasional watering in dry climates.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - **Seeds**: Sow directly in the garden in early spring or fall.
    - **Division**: Separate clumps in spring or fall.
    - **Cuttings**: Root softwood cuttings in water or soil.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Flowers and leaves can be harvested **anytime during the growing season**, but are most potent when flowers first bloom.
    - Dry leaves and flowers for long-term storage.
