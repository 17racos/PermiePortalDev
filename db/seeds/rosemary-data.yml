  description: |-
    Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a woody, aromatic, evergreen herb that grows as a perennial shrub. It can reach up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall and produces needle-like leaves with a strong fragrance. In the right conditions, rosemary can live for decades and becomes a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant. It blooms in late winter through spring with small blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators.

    The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy, or loamy soil with a slightly alkaline pH. Rosemary is highly drought-resistant once established and prefers warm climates with mild winters. In colder regions, it can be grown in containers and moved indoors during winter.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun (6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily).
    - Requires well-drained soil with low to moderate moisture.
    - Avoid overwatering, as rosemary is susceptible to root rot.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Cuttings: Best methodâ€”take 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) cuttings from young stems, remove lower leaves, and root in moist soil or water.
    - Layering: Bend a stem to the ground, cover part of it with soil, and allow it to develop roots before cutting from the parent plant.
    - Seeds: Difficult to germinate; takes weeks to months for successful sprouting.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Can be harvested year-round in warm climates.
    - Clip sprigs as needed once the plant is well-established (after at least 1 year).
    - Best flavor comes from young, fresh growth before flowering.
