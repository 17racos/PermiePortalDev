  description: |-
    Dutch clover *Trifolium repens* is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe and Central Asia. It typically reaches 4 to 6 inches in height and spreads up to 12 inches through creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a characteristic white, crescent-shaped band on each leaflet and produces white to pinkish flower heads from early to late summer. Commonly found in lawns, pastures, and roadsides, Dutch clover is valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and as a forage crop for livestock. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
