  description: |-
    Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) is a hardy perennial herbaceous plant known for its striking purple-pink daisy-like flowers with spiky, cone-shaped centers. It grows up to 90 cm (3 feet) tall, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is widely used for its medicinal benefits and as an ornamental flower in gardens.

    Echinacea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy, or loamy soils. It attracts pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds and is commonly grown in medicinal gardens, prairie restorations, and food forests.

    ### Sun and Water Requirements
    - Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade.
    - Requires well-drained soil; does well in sandy or loamy conditions.
    - Drought-tolerant once established but benefits from occasional deep watering.

    ### Methods to Propagate
    - Seeds: Direct sow in fall or cold stratify before planting in spring for better germination.
    - Division: Established plants can be divided every 3–4 years in early spring.
    - Cuttings: Root cuttings can be used to propagate new plants.

    ### When to Harvest
    - Flowers should be harvested when fully open for fresh use or drying.
    - Leaves can be harvested anytime during the growing season.
    - Roots are harvested in the plant’s second or third year for medicinal preparations.
  purpose: |-
    Echinacea serves multiple functions in a permaculture system:

    - Edible: Petals and young leaves are used in teas, salads, and herbal infusions.
    - Medicinal: Known for immune-boosting properties, used to fight infections and colds.
    - Pollinator: Flowers attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds.
    - Wildlife Attractor: Provides nectar for beneficial insects and birds.
    - Mulcher: Spent plants and cuttings break down easily, adding organic matter to the soil.
    - Dynamic Accumulator: Draws up nutrients such as calcium and magnesium to enrich the soil.
    - Border Plant: Works well in garden borders, wildflower meadows, and permaculture guilds.
