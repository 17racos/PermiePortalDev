  description: |-
    Lavender is a perennial herb renowned for its fragrant purple flowers and silvery-green foliage. It typically grows to a height of 60–90 cm (24–36 inches) and a width of 60–75 cm (24–30 inches). Thriving in full sun, lavender prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering; overwatering can lead to root rot. Propagation is commonly achieved through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer. Harvesting of the flowers is best done when they are in full bloom, usually in mid to late summer, by cutting the stems just above the leaves.
